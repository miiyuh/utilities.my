*Last Updated: 2025-08-06*

This Privacy Policy governs how we collect, use, protect, and handle your information when you use our web-based utility tools and services.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Our Commitment to Privacy

utilities.my is built with **privacy by design** principles. We believe in giving users complete control over their data while providing powerful, client-side utility tools.

### 1.2 Scope of This Policy

This policy describes our practices regarding data collection and usage across all our utility tools, including:

- Text processing tools (case conversion, statistics, markdown preview)
- Media tools (image to ASCII, color picker, file compression)
- Productivity tools (date calculator, timezone converter, unit converter)
- Fun tools (QR generator, wheel spinner, random sorter)

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Client-Side Processing

Our application is designed with privacy by design principles. **Most of our tools operate entirely within your browser** using client-side processing, which means:

- **Your data stays on your device** - Files and text you process remain in your browser
- **No server uploads** - We don't upload your sensitive data to our servers
- **Real-time processing** - Conversions and transformations happen instantly on your device
- **No tracking** - We don't monitor what tools you use or how you use them

### 2.2 Data We May Store Locally

We use browser local storage **only** for:

- **Theme Preferences**: Your preferred theme (light/dark mode) and UI customization settings
- **Tool Settings**: Last used configurations and user preferences for specific utilities
- **User Experience**: Convenience settings like default units, formats, and recently used options

> **Note**: All this data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to our servers.

### 2.3 Data We Explicitly Do NOT Collect

We want to be crystal clear about what we **don't** collect:

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone, address)
- File contents you upload or process through our tools
- Text or data you input into our utilities
- IP addresses or precise location data
- Browsing history or detailed usage analytics
- Device fingerprinting or tracking identifiers
- Cookies for tracking purposes
- Third-party advertising data

## 3. How We Use Information

### 3.1 Enhancing Your Experience

The minimal information we store locally is used to:

- Remember your preferred theme and interface settings

### 3.2 Service Improvement

Anonymous, aggregated data helps us:

- Identify which tools are most useful to users

## 4. Data Security and Protection
